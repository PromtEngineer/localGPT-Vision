localGPT-Vision is an end-to-end vision-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It allows users to upload and index documents (PDFs and images), ask questions about the content, and receive responses along with relevant document snippets. The retrieval is performed using the [Colqwen](https://huggingface.co/vidore/colqwen2-v0.1) or [ColPali](https://huggingface.co/blog/manu/colpali) models, and the retrieved pages are passed to a Vision Language Model (VLM) for generating responses. Currently, the code supports these VLMs: 

- [Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct)
- [LLAMA-3.2-11B-Vision](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision)
- [Pixtral-12B-2409](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Pixtral-12B-2409)
- [Molmo-7B-O-0924](https://huggingface.co/allenai/Molmo-7B-O-0924)
- [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_chat)
- [OpenAI GPT-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision)
- [LLAMA-3.2 with Ollama](https://ollama.com/blog/llama3.2-vision)

The project is built on top of the [Byaldi](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/byaldi) library.

## Features
- End-to-End Vision-Based RAG: Combines visual document retrieval with language models for comprehensive answers.
- Document Upload and Indexing: Upload PDFs and images, which are then indexed using ColPali for retrieval.
- Chat Interface: Engage in a conversational interface to ask questions about the uploaded documents.
- Session Management: Create, rename, switch between, and delete chat sessions.
- Model Selection: Choose between different Vision Language Models (Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4 etc).
- Persistent Indexes: Indexes are saved on disk and loaded upon application restart. 

## Architecture
localGPT-Vision is built as an end-to-end vision-based RAG system. T he architecture comprises two main components:

1. Visual Document Retrieval with Colqwen and ColPali:
   - [Colqwen](https://huggingface.co/vidore/colqwen2-v0.1) and [ColPali](https://huggingface.co/blog/manu/colpali) are Vision Encoders designed for efficient document retrieval solely using the image representation of document pages.
   - It embeds page images directly, leveraging visual cues like layout, fonts, figures, and tables without relying on OCR or text extraction.
   - During indexing, document pages are converted into image embeddings and stored.
   - During querying, the user query is matched against these embeddings to retrieve the most relevant document pages.

2. Response Generation with Vision Language Models:
   - The retrieved document images are passed to a Vision Language Model (VLM).
   - Supported models include Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, LLAMA3.2, Pixtral, Molmo, Google Gemini, and OpenAI GPT-4.
   - These models generate responses by understanding both the visual and textual content of the documents.
   - NOTE: The quality of the responses is highly dependent on the VLM used and the resolution of the document images.

This architecture eliminates the need for complex text extraction pipelines and provides a more holistic understanding of documents by considering their visual elements. You don't need any chunking strategies or selection of embeddings model or retrieval strategy used in traditional RAG systems.

   ```

5. Run the Application
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Access the Application
   Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5050/
   ```
## Debugging

To assist with debugging localGPT-Vision, certain additional dependencies need to be installed on your system. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment for debugging purposes.

### Required Packages

Install the necessary packages using the following commands:

#### On Ubuntu/Debian-based Systems

1. **Update Package Lists**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install Poppler Libraries and Utilities**

   These libraries are essential for handling PDF files.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install libpoppler-cpp-dev poppler-utils
   ```

3. **Verify Installation of `pdftoppm`**

   Check the version to ensure it's installed correctly:

   ```bash
   pdftoppm -v
   ```

4. **Install Additional Dependencies**

   These packages are required for building and managing libraries.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install cmake pkgconfig python3-poppler-qt5
   ```

   ### Note

   Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to run `sudo` commands on your machine. This setup is specifically tailored for Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, and steps might vary slightly if using a different Linux distribution or macOS.

   - Documents are indexed using ColPali, which creates embeddings based on the visual content of the document pages.
   - The indexes are stored in the byaldi_indices/ directory.
3. Session Management:
   - Each chat session has a unique ID and stores its own index and chat history.
   - Sessions are saved on disk and loaded upon application restart.
4. Query Processing:
   - User queries are sent to the backend.
   - The query is embedded and matched against the visual embeddings of document pages to retrieve relevant pages.
5. Response Generation with Vision Language Models:
   - The retrieved document images and the user query are passed to the selected Vision Language Model (Qwen, Gemini, or GPT-4).
   - The VLM generates a response by understanding both the visual and textual content of the documents.
6. Display Results:
   - The response and relevant document snippets are displayed in the chat interface.
